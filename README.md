# Disaster Alleviation Foundation
This web app allows users to register and keep track of current disasters around the world. 
Users can also make monetary and goods donations, which can then be allocated to specific disasters. 

This web app was developed using Visual Studio and C# (ASP.NET Core 6.0). 
To store the appâ€™s data Entity Framework Core along with dependency injection was used to communicate with an SQL Database hosted on Azure.
